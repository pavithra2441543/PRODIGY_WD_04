      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>My name is Pavithra B, a BCA student at Christ University. I started my journey in web development out of curiosity and interest in how websites are built. Over time, I began building websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I found a deep passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly designs. I enjoy learning new technologies and improving my skills every day. My goal is to become a professional web developer in the future and contribute to meaningful digital experiences.</p>
